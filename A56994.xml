            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be employ'd in a <hi>Negotiation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman and the Ancient <hi>Brittons,</hi> I was not only upon the Borders, and (as it were) the <hi>Limbs</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64126:3"/>of <hi>Wales,</hi> but have travell'd through the (very <hi>Bowels</hi> of the Country; in which Journey there did ſalute me ſo many <hi>occurrences</hi> worthy of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear a Deſcription of them, and from preſenting you with the (as I may ſay) <hi>Wallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy</hi> of my Voyage.</p>
            <p>I make bold to imitate one <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> who ſtill as he went <hi>dragooning</hi> about the World, deſcrib'd the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, and (as it were) the<note n="*" place="margin">

I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> was not far, but perhaps it was <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd</hi> with as great variety both of Pleaſure and Peril as a longer Progreſs; neither are
<pb facs="tcp:64126:5"/>my Remarques very ſolemn and ſtately, but yet they were ſuch as gratify'd my curioſity, and pleas'd my humor as well as the Obſervations of longer Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</p>
            <p>Such as they are (Sir!) I humbly crave leave to devote them to your Peruſal, as the moſt ſignal <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of that venerable <hi>Eſteem</hi> I have for you. I wave your <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and forbear to Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or to <hi>deſcant</hi> in your Praiſe. You are too <hi>Copious</hi> a Subject even for the moſt <hi>Tranſcendent</hi> Oratory. I liſt not to diſplay your Perſonal Accompliſhmentſ, which are
<pb facs="tcp:64126:6"/>ſo eminent and conſpicuous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the World. I know an Attempt of that Nature would be too great a <hi>Violence</hi> to your <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and I am ſure too hard a <hi>Task</hi> for my <hi>Capacity.</hi> My preſent Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (Sir!) is to put this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Book into your Hand, and to deſire you to <hi>Honour</hi> the Author in accepting, and to <hi>Divert</hi> your ſelf in reading of it; for poſſibly you may find ſo much <hi>Comoedy</hi> in this <hi>Walk,</hi> as may diſpoſe you to ſmile away an hour in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of it. The Relations are not <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ordinary,</hi> and perhaps as pleaſant as they
<pb facs="tcp:64126:6"/>are <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>unuſual.</hi> I do not know that any Travellor <hi>jogging</hi> in the <hi>ſame</hi> Road hath given the <hi>ſame</hi> Account of Things, or hath made the ſame Deſcriptions which I here preſent you with; ſo that my Remarques are <hi>ſpick and ſpan</hi> new, and if they are <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> they are not unlike the Perſons upon whom they are written.

<pb facs="tcp:64126:7"/>that hath a Vein of <hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puddiniſm</hi> running through alls his Actions, and therefore I thought if not improper to ſprinkle here and there ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the <hi>Blew-jacket,</hi> and to <hi>Merry-Andrew</hi> my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs a little farther as I went with jocund Obſervations, that the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> might be agreeable to the <hi>Matter</hi> it Treats of. So that if a <hi>Welch-man</hi> is a <hi>Jeſt,</hi> as all the World ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a Living <hi>Pun,</hi> a walking <hi>Conundrum,</hi> and a breathing <hi>Witticiſm;</hi> Then have I made one Joke upon another.</p>

            <p>I am not unſenſible that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of another Nature and Complexion are more agreeable to that <hi>Character</hi> you bear in the World; <hi>Machiavel</hi> and <hi>Malvezzi,</hi> or ſome diſcourſe of the Maxims of <hi>Policy,</hi> would be a more ſutable Subject for your Contemplation: But (Sir!)

            <head>WALLOGRAPHY OR The Britton deſcrib'd, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>UPon the Firſt of <hi>June</hi> 1673, having taken leave of my Friends, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Meſſage, a little tiny Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to be uttered by word of mouth, together with a Letter to be deliver'd into the hands of one of the moſt Reverend Taphies, I began to have ſome thoughts of <hi>rigging</hi> my ſelf out for mine intended Voyage; and to that end I ſpatterdaſh't my Legs with a pair of Cuckolds boots, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adorn'd or furniſh't my hand
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64126:9"/>with battooning Cudgel, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entertain'd in my Retinue a whole <hi>Diſtick</hi> of Spannels.</p>
            <p>Upon the Fourth of <hi>June,</hi> I turn'd one ſide upon <hi>London,</hi> and the other toward <hi>Wales;</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which was ſo be the Period and Term of my Journey. We travelled all that day with much pleaſure, being treated as we went, with the <hi>Delicacies</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the Air was <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>ſoft;</hi> the Fields were <hi>trim</hi> and <hi>neat;</hi> the Sun <hi>benign</hi> and <hi>cheriſhing;</hi> the whole Creation was <hi>obliging,</hi> and from every thing we met, we receiv'd a <hi>Civility;</hi> ſo that this firſt day paſs'd over with much ſatisfaction. I do not remember that we ſaw any thing remarkable, unleſs 'twas a Fellow driving a <hi>tyr'd Cow,</hi> whoſe ſlow motion he now and then quickn'd by wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pendulum</hi> of her Tail, and (as it were) curling it into a ſcrew
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64126:9"/>he <hi>twiſted</hi> her forward, and bor'd the Air with this Living <hi>Augre;</hi> Me-thoughts a very pretty trick to make a wimble of his Beaſt, and a handſome way to inſinuate her along, and to improve her pace. 'Twas far beyond the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of a wiſp of hay, in regard <hi>Fear</hi> urges more than <hi>Flattery</hi> can allure, and all Creatures are more ready to eaſe their <hi>Backs,</hi> than to fill their <hi>Bellies;</hi> how Scorpions pretty crabbedly apply'd will make a thing caper, and increaſe his Career far beyond the <hi>temptation</hi> of Cake and Marmalade! and a Cat of <hi>Nine-Tails</hi> will drive bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a diſh of Sweet-meats can invite and draw. This was the Method the Bumpkin us'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the <hi>progreſſive Motion</hi> of the Animal; which indeed is far different from the Cuſtom and Practice of the <hi>Croatians;</hi> For whereas this man made his Beaſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64126:10"/>proceed by thruſting at <hi>one end,</hi> the Tail; They make their tyr'd Jades jog on by putting at the other, the <hi>Fore-top.</hi> We began to ſubſcribe to <hi>Carteſius</hi>'s opinion, that Animals were Engins; For 'tis like, the <hi>Clock-work</hi> of the Cow was ſomewhat diſorder'd, and the Machine (like a Jack) was run down and (rood ſtill, till this Artiſt wound it up, and ſet the movements a going.</p>
            <p>Being indifferently refreſht by the vertue of that Paſſage, we went forward very couragiouſly, and after a little time were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with the proſpect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scene, which was laid in a Meddow by a River-ſide, where we overtook a <hi>Rat-catcher</hi> and a <hi>Fiſherman</hi> diſputing Precedency, and the Preheminency of their Profeſſions: The Rat-catcher ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd that his Calling was moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, in regard the object of his

            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64126:11"/>
            <p>We left theſe Fellows very hot in controverſy, which could not be decided, and paſs'd on, till at length we arrived to a little knot, or <hi>Aſteriſm</hi> of houſes ſtanding, or rather lying on the <hi>Crump</hi> of a Hill, rais'd ſomewhat <hi>proudly</hi> above the ordinary level; and methoughts, lookt down with ſomewhat of <hi>Diſdain</hi> upon the Humble Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Who was the Founder of this <hi>Hamlet</hi> is not certainly known, but we perceiv'd the <hi>Thacker</hi> had been a great <hi>Benefactor.</hi> As for the Nativity of the Place, the Foundation was laid under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Configuration</hi> of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: ſo that the <hi>Tinkers</hi> and <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> and the dregs of mankind that dwelt there, expected not Proſperity, nor hop'd to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd and ſublimated into the <hi>Flower</hi> of the People. The main <hi>ſtreſs</hi> of Government lay upon the <hi>ſhoulder</hi> of a ſingle man, who was a

               <hi>Bear-ward</hi> by Office, and being the moſt ſubſtantial Perſon was thought fit to be <hi>inveſted</hi> with the ſole Authority of the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; A moſt proper Magiſtrate for ſuch wild Savages! We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that this Village had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways <hi>into</hi> it, as it had ways <hi>out</hi> of it, which were equal in number to the Points of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. The <hi>purling</hi> Brook that crawl'd by it, the <hi>reeking</hi> Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill that breath'd within it, the <hi>crook-back'd</hi> Elm that ſtands <hi>cring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> near it, and the Pack-<hi>ſaddle</hi> Steeple that ſtood <hi>ſquinting</hi> over it, made a pretty Draught of an handſome <hi>Landſkip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of this place were much addicted to the vice of <hi>Stealing;</hi> every thing <hi>ſticks</hi> to their Pitchy Fingers, and they have ſuch an <hi>attractive</hi> vertue, that, wherever they come, all things trot after the Magnetiſm of their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64126:12"/>Perſons. A Fellow ſquotting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a criket in a room we were in, and riſing up from his ſeat, the ſtool on a ſudden (as if tackt to his A—) immediately marcht after him, to the great amazement of the woman of the houſe, who did not ſuſpect that his <hi>Bum</hi> had <hi>hands,</hi> or that her <hi>Stool</hi> ſo nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could have us'd its <hi>legs.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſpying a <hi>Cylinder</hi> of Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudding pretty thick in the waſt lolling upon the table, whilſt the Hoſteſs turn'd her back, in the very <hi>twinkling</hi> of her head, <hi>pocuſs'd</hi> it into Fob, and ſo ſhrowded its Dimenſions into a ſecond Bag.</p>
            <p>The <hi>approaching</hi> night and our wearied <hi>limbs</hi> compell'd us to lodge among theſe Tenements; Having almoſt <hi>worn</hi> out our ſelves by tedious Travel, we reſolv'd here to repair our <hi>breeches:</hi> But (alas!) this <hi>mending</hi> (I allude to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64126:12"/>
               <hi>Taylouriſm</hi>) was little better than meer <hi>Botching.</hi> For, whereas we thought to have renew'd nature, and to have recreated our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with the pleaſant whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs of <hi>Rural Delicacies,</hi> we could ſcarce ſo much as even patch her up with the <hi>hurden Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of a red-lattic'd Inn; The <hi>foretop</hi> of a Carrot, and a few parcht Peaſe were our choiceſt Provender, which fill'd our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities ſo full of wind, that we thought we had got the <hi>Four Quarters</hi> in our Bellys, which made ſuch <hi>Squibs</hi> of our Breeches, that (like the fifth of <hi>November</hi>) we were continually diſcharging of <hi>Rockets</hi> and <hi>Crackers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day dreſs'd with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora,</hi> nay before ſhe had put on her <hi>Indian</hi> gown, we ſet out with the Sun, who bearing us company but a little while withdrew into an apartment behind a cloud, at

But that which terrify'd us moſt of all, was <hi>water</hi> which we ſaw of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral colours, ſometimes <hi>red,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>black;</hi> which put us in mind of thoſe <hi>Prodigious Rains</hi> the Philoſophers ſpeak of, <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Ink;</hi> But overtaking a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> and <hi>Red-Oker</hi> man, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd 'twas the <hi>Diſtillations</hi> of their Buggets. But that which gave <hi>wings</hi> to time, and made it <hi>fly</hi> merrily while we were in the company of theſe Vagrants, were the frequent <hi>Quarrels</hi> that were <hi>broacht</hi> between them, which at length were improv'd into ſevere <hi>Buffetings.</hi> The <hi>Object</hi> of both their Occupations lyes hid in the Earth, and they work like Moles,

            <p>After another days Travel in Duſt and Sun, we ſaluted a good handſome Town, not a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling in crookedneſs a middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiz'd <hi>ſhooing horn;</hi> At the entrance into it, the <hi>uncarpetneſs</hi> (as I may ſay) of the Floor, or (in other words) the <hi>unevenneſs</hi> of the ſtreets ſomewhat diſlocating the poſition of our almoſt <hi>tript up</hi>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64126:14"/>We were inform'd that this Town was much infeſted with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome Viſitants, <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice;</hi> inſomuch that the Inhabitants have a <hi>Rat-catcher</hi> at a certain Penſion, as the only <hi>Talis-man</hi> againſt ſuch noxious Vermin.</p>
            <p>Having left this <hi>Town</hi> behind us, we come to a <hi>Wood</hi> on our left hand, nigh unto which was a diſcontented Fountain <hi>murmuring</hi> as it run (we did not enquire a what) and <hi>bubling</hi> forth ſeemingly much Diſſatisfaction. This wood was a <hi>promiſcuous Babble</hi> of all vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables. A <hi>throng</hi> of trees of all ranks and qualities; we refreſht ourſelves a little under this natural <hi>Arbour,</hi> and being prety and cheerful in this circumſtance of Place; one of our <hi>Caravan</hi> began to expreſs his joy in ſome notes of Muſick, who as ſoon as he began to ſtrike up with his <hi>Pite</hi> (thinking he had but one) he preſently perceiv'd it to be

               <hi>lullaby'd</hi> as ſtill and quiet as Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant Infant; the Day was Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, bright and clear; the Earth (like a Foreſter) was clad in green. The Figure of this Field was a <hi>Parallellogrammum,</hi> the Style was ſituate South-Eaſt-by North, and conſiſted of a <hi>climax</hi> of three rails, over which we convey'd our ſelves by <hi>Elevation of Leg;</hi> near the entrance into the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, we obſerv'd an hole or <hi>caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the hedge, which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Hogs had oftentimes <hi>threded;</hi> but the Hedger had <hi>glaz'd</hi> it with a <hi>pane</hi> of Furze.</p>
            <p>Having ambled over ſome Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs on this (as it were) <hi>New-Market</hi> Heath, we perceiv'd it to degenerate and to grow worſe and worſe, and (like an handſome neck of Mutton) to determine in the unevenneſs of a Rock, or Scrag. A little while after we winded a <hi>Cordwainer,</hi> who (as he

            <p>We follow'd our Noſes from hence, and were directed by the <hi>Clue</hi> of a long Hedge; which after a great extent in length, we found to be <hi>Tagg'd</hi> with a rough Lane; turning from which a little toward the right, we overtook a <hi>Church</hi> ſtanding (like an Ace) and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by it ſelf, at ſome diſtance from the Town; which whether <hi>it</hi> run from the Pariſh, or the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh <hi>from it,</hi> we are not as yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; though we have moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect the <hi>latter;</hi> in regard as to outward appearance the weak Conſtitution of the Fabrick ſeem'd not much to be addicted to run.

As for the firſt, as ſoon as I ſaw it, I had greater reaſon to congratulate my Eye-ſight than I had before; for ſhe was bleſt with a moſt <hi>raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Aſpect, and a ſnug Face, moſt prodigiouſly grac'd with a dainty fine Noſe, faſten'd in its middle; which is not like ſome Snouts that look more upon one Cheek, than they do upon the other, but ſhews equal reſpect to both, not at all <hi>diſobliging</hi> the right by <hi>fleering</hi> too much on the leſt. And then for her Eyes, they are excellent at twireing, and will be ſure to keep her Noſe <hi>ſafe,</hi> (I'le warrant you) for one looks <hi>one</hi> way, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64126:20"/>
               <hi>another.</hi> The Woman had a Mouth too, which was ſomewhat bigger than that of a Musket, though not twice as big as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious bore of a Blew Noggin. This Mouth ſhe put but to <hi>one uſe,</hi> and that's the ſame that we put ours to, that is to eat three or tout Meals in a day; for it ſeems where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other Women often uſe theirs in <hi>prating</hi> and <hi>twatling,</hi> we perceiv'd that this <hi>ſav</hi>'d her <hi>Mouth</hi> and ſpake through her <hi>Noſe.</hi> As we have given you the Picture of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo now let's preſent you with a Landskip of her Fortune. As for her Lands, that is, Paſture-ground, and Meadow, we could not diſcern, but that (like a ſpot upon the Globe) they took but little room upon the ſurface of the Earth, and (like the Poſſeſſions of <hi>Alcibiades</hi>) were but a little ſpeck to the World. A little Muck
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64126:21"/>would dung her Fallow; one high Table T— (to ſpeak in the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Dialect) will much enrich it, and an Ear of Corn will go near to ſow it; 'tis like ſhe hath Graſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a couple of Rabbets. Having ſurvey'd the Paramour, and the Portion of this Nivelling Cobler, after a ſingle ſip of ſixes out of a Tin Pot, and a <hi>Treble</hi> go-down out of a cup of <hi>Double;</hi> after a <hi>right-line</hi> ſcrape with <hi>left</hi> Leg; and uncouth doffing of a bad Bonnet, after <hi>ſlinking</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement by way of thanks for his Society, attended by his Cobler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to the confines of a Yard, at the claſping together of two lowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gates in the preſence of a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent</hi> and <hi>Burly</hi> Elme, I ſolemnly took leave of my Fellow-Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. After his departure I was forc'd to beguile away the time in the ſhady <hi>ſolitude</hi> of ſilent thoughts,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64126:21"/>which before I ſpent in the <hi>brisker Entertainments</hi> of Diſcourſe and Dialogue: I had not long buſy'd my faculties with inward ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but I met with variety of Objects courting with their <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> my almoſt diſtracted Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations. I ſaw <hi>Three Stones</hi> ſo artificially ſet, that they repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Figure of a convenient <hi>Stile.</hi> Methoughts the Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of it was very curious; for one ſtone about a Foot ſquare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plac'd perpendiculary upright, its Northern Extremity was croſs'd by another at right Angles; on the other ſide whereof was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted another perpendicular corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to the former. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of theſe Materials made a pretty Fabrick, over which a Man might commodiouſly paſs; its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face was ſmooth, not <hi>tufted</hi> with ſnags, which are always catching
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64126:22"/>and <hi>ſnarling</hi> at your Cloaths, to the great <hi>Diſguize</hi> and Damage of your Breeches; about two yards diſtant there was a Croſs delv'd in the Earth, which ſeem'd either an Argument of <hi>Popiſh Superſtition,</hi> or a Sign or Mark of the Pariſh <hi>Selvidge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Departing from hence, we mov'd through a Cloſe very <hi>popa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> with Mutton; there being, (as it were) a whole <hi>Academy</hi> of Sheep <hi>ſizeing</hi> on a Hay-rick, not botled out into Commons, but Geometrically carv'd into good <hi>Sexangular</hi> Luncheons. 'Twas Foot-cloath'd (as it were) with Straw near five yards about, upon which were tumbling a <hi>Bag-piper,</hi> and an <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>us,</hi> who wanton'd ſo long till (like Dogs) at laſt their Play determin'd in a ſharp conflict. The Man of Muſick buffeted the Jugler to <hi>ſome tune,</hi> who adding
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64126:22"/>two or three <hi>howls</hi> to the <hi>Notes</hi> of his Drone-pipe, by cleanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance did vaniſh from him. The Piper appear'd of a tawny Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, his <hi>Noſe</hi> bending with an Arch upward; his <hi>Eyes</hi> being ſomewhat hollow, ſeem'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the <hi>promontory</hi> of his jetting Forehead. In a word, there was <hi>charm</hi> enough in his Aſpect; He was well built, his whole <hi>Frame</hi> and contexture was <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;</hi> I muſt needs ſay, I have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom met with any handſomer <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> or <hi>Platform</hi> of a Man. But though his <hi>Perſon</hi> was neat and <hi>uniform,</hi> yet his habit and <hi>garb</hi> was full of <hi>deformity,</hi> and there were as many <hi>Soloeciſms</hi> and <hi>Incohoeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> on theſe, as there was <hi>Congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> commendable in that. He wore a <hi>Miſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ellany</hi> of Apparel, a <hi>Gallimaſry</hi> of Cloaths, as I humbly conceive, 'twas a <hi>Tyth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64126:23"/>Suit,</hi> compos'd of various and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts; ſuch a <hi>Club</hi> of Raggs, and <hi>Randeſvouz</hi> of Fragments, muſt needs be a Collection (like the Jerkin of the Jay) of ſeveral Feathers from divers Birds. His Doublet (which indeed was but one great Patch in <hi>Folio</hi>) was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>heterogeneous</hi> from the reſt of his Attire; he had worn his Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets into perfect <hi>Fringe,</hi> (ſo that he ſeem'd to be ſurrounded with the <hi>remnant</hi> of a Curtain) and had <hi>thin'd</hi> his Elbows into their firſt <hi>Principles.</hi> 'Twas of a Mouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour hue, and (as near as I could gueſs) it appear'd to be the <hi>Reſult</hi> of an old Cloak; both its firſt <hi>Crop</hi> and <hi>Latter-Math</hi> too were both worn off; and it was ſo Thread-bare, that it had almoſt <hi>founder'd</hi> three or four of his beſt Lice; wherefore we advis'd him to hang it no longer on a <hi>Knaves</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:64126:23"/>back, but to condemn it to the Houſewifery of a Shooe-clout. The Relicks that were left of his tatter'd Breeches were one <hi>Story</hi> pendulous below his Coat. His Inſtrument (like a Gizzard) was tuck'd under his arm, which by <hi>ſhog</hi> of Elbow, he did <hi>hug</hi> into harmony, and <hi>ſqueeze</hi> out of its Womb moſt raviſhing Ditties. We made but few Remarks on the Perſon of the Jugler, only we thought it appear'd to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>ſleathy;</hi> his Noddle was ſhrowded under the <hi>Patronage</hi> of a collop'd Hat, whoſe <hi>indented</hi> Margin being ſomewhat frail, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd from the equality of an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal</hi> Poſition, and flapping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on both ſides, and hugging his Ears, forc'd the poor Man to look as it were through a <hi>Spout.</hi> He had a bunch of Bibbond in his hand, which poſſibly might be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64126:24"/>the effect of his laſt <hi>Vomits;</hi> for we ſuppoſe having had a ſurfeit of Silk-worms, and a <hi>Loom</hi> in his <hi>Throat,</hi> he can <hi>diſgorge</hi> more at a caſt, than an ordinary Weaver can work in a weeks time. His little <hi>pointing-ſtick</hi> and Tin Diſhes, with other Implements of his Art, made an horrible noiſe and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion</hi> in his Pocket, even to the terrour and amazement of an <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bee,</hi> who was <hi>rioting</hi> on the Luxuries, and was wantonly <hi>bask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on the Sunny <hi>Terrace</hi> of a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Thiſtle. Nay, the jing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his Tackle did alarm an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Waſps</hi> and <hi>Hornets,</hi> which lay <hi>encamp'd</hi> hard by under the roof of a ſhady Furz buſh; Theſe made ſuch an on-ſet on Hocus with their <hi>Lanſprizades,</hi> that making a <hi>Pin-cuſhion</hi> of his Body, they ſtuck it ſo full of Needles, that the <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency</hi> of their Weapons, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64126:24"/>piercing to the quick, made the poor fellow curvete and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate himſelf nimbly into two or three dancing <hi>Capreolls.</hi> He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd on his back as thick a <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> of Stings as a Hog of Briſtles. He was ſwell'd to a treble propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beyond what he was; his <hi>Hands</hi> were grown too big for his Pockets, and could have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception into thoſe narrow <hi>Cloſets.</hi> The <hi>circumference</hi> of his head was hugely increas'd beyond the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter</hi> of his Hat; ſo that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity</hi> of the former could not be contain'd within the <hi>Concavity</hi> of the latter. In a word, being magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd beyond the <hi>fallacy</hi> of the beſt Glaſs, his Cloaths were too little for his <hi>enlarg'd</hi> Dimenſions; ſo that he burſt through the confines of his <hi>ſcanty</hi> caſe. Means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently was us'd for the levelling of this Mountainous Vagrant, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64126:25"/>Hide-ſwoln; He was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plung'd into a Bath of Honey, which though a preſent cure of his Diſeaſe and Malady, yet was as great a cauſe of an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as bad; For a certain <hi>Bear</hi> not far off got his Medicine in the wind, and came galloping for a lick of her admir'd Dainties; which when the Jugſer perceiv'd, having loſt through fear the retentive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he adulterated her Diſh by a mixture of ſomewhat that was of the ſame colour, though not ſo ſweet. The Jugler <hi>hooft</hi> it away with a winged ſpeed; the Bear with a pair up and a pair down moſt ſwiftly purſu'd him. We ſtaid not to ſee the Iſſue of the Race, but advanc'd forward in a regular progreſſive motion, who after a little time were croſs'd by a Rivulet, which wrigled along with a crooked current; over
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64126:25"/>which we convey'd our ſelves by <hi>ſaltation.</hi> On the other ſide of the Bank was a little <hi>Arabia</hi> of Sand, enough (I ſuppoſe) to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all the <hi>Hour-glaſſes</hi> in the Country, nay perhaps and that of <hi>Time</hi> too till the laſt minute; near this Mountain of Sand lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at length <hi>two Iron</hi> Wedges contiguous to a Block in <hi>Felio,</hi> which we ſuppos'd was to be rent into collops, and to become a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> to hungry <hi>Vulcan.</hi> There was a numerous <hi>Family</hi> of chips about it, which were different in ſhape, colour, and bigneſs, ſo that they ſeem'd not to be the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the ſame Parent; they lay in a <hi>Chaos</hi> without any order, amidſt which confuſion the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky <hi>Gibeonite</hi> that hew'd them loſt the head of his Ax: The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collation</hi> whereof ſeem'd ominous to the Man, and made him ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64126:26"/>leave his work: My ſelf and a couple of <hi>Gadarens</hi> that were driving Swine, made a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſcrutiny for the <hi>Noddle</hi> of the Tool; which after ſome time we perceiv'd to lie entomb'd under the <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> of a good luſty ſhaving. We did not perceive that it was much damnify'd by its retirement, only the dampneſs of its <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> did ſomewhat abate and obſcure the eagerneſs of its edge, and the Luſtre of its Aſpect. We deliver'd it into the hands of its Owner, who preſently faſten'd it to the ſhoulders to which it did belong.</p>
            <p>After a ſmall offering of thanks for our careful ſearch, the Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds turn'd to the left, and we wheeling to the right, after we had jog'd over ſome few Acres of a <hi>phlegmatick</hi> and cold conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, moſt happily pop'd on the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64126:26"/>
               <hi>warmer</hi> Turf of a pleaſant Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. 'Twas <hi>fring'd</hi> about with a Mound of Elder-trees, whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious height, and luxurient Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches gave impregnable ſecurity to the neſtling Birds. The <hi>Diameter</hi> of a Path run through the midſt, whoſe <hi>Poles</hi> were tranſverſe or thwarted the <hi>hinges</hi> of the World. 'Twas environ'd on both tides with a <hi>Sea</hi> of Corn, which being mov'd by the breath of <hi>AEolus,</hi> (that Bellows of the World) what a <hi>Flux</hi> and Re-flux was there of <hi>waves</hi> of Wheat! We paſs'd through this Territory and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Ceres</hi> with the moſt exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed delight. How did that <hi>Goddeſs</hi> ſit in Triumph there! What crowds of <hi>Clients</hi> bowing their ears to her Commands and Dictates? Every Land was parted with the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of a Balk, on ſeveral of which lay the <hi>Habiliments</hi> of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſters;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64126:27"/>An extended ſleeve of a Red Waſt-coat, embracing the collar of a Leathern Jump, and touching the hem or a <hi>grafted</hi> Petticoat, preſented us with the Idea of a pretty <hi>Ward-Robe.</hi> We went out of this Incloſure through the weſtern paſſage of a <hi>three-raild</hi> Gate: Upon which there did directly ſhoot the <hi>aged</hi> Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a <hi>decrepit</hi> wall; which over-topping our ſtature in height and tallneſs, we were forc'd to add to our quantity a Nine-inch-ſtone, that raiſing our Dimenſions we might peep over it. There was ſcarce any thing remarkable on the other ſide, unleſs a vaſt Rolling-pin of humane ordure. 'Twas four Inches Diameter, and probably diſcharg'd from a <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> bore, and that near upon the confines of a tuft of Wormwood, whoſe bitter ſcent mixt with the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64126:27"/>unſavouryneſs of <hi>Excrementitious</hi> Atoms breath'd a medly kind of ſtink, and gave but ordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to our offended No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils. Among the Ruines of this Mound we diſcover'd the <hi>Snout</hi> and ſome other <hi>Limbs</hi> of a <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd</hi> Dial; It was not ſo defac'd, but that we could diſcover in its <hi>Phyſiognomy</hi> ſome <hi>martyr'd</hi> Figures, that were yet legible, and there were ſome Relicks of Lines, that were not quite obliterated. Time I preſume (being vext perhaps that it ſhould obſerve its motions) hath ſet its Grinders in it, and out of <hi>envy,</hi> and malice hath quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd it. I am apt to think that this pile of Stones ſtood in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, where 'twas firſt bred, as may be conjectur'd from an adjacent Pillar, whoſe preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy (we fancy) produc'd this <hi>litter</hi> of Stones, it being the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64126:28"/>of theſe <hi>rockie Bales.</hi> We advanc'd to the Orifice of this <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pideous Womb,</hi> where were hewing Mortals, by cruel <hi>Midwifery</hi> dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out the Offspring of teeming Earth. 'Twas an <hi>unpoliſh'd</hi> ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the Workmen were as <hi>rough</hi> and <hi>uneven</hi> as the Proſpect; and the Artificers were as intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable and ſtubborn as the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, or Object of their Art. Two of the moſt <hi>Brawny</hi> Paviers ſtood lolling by the Mattock that pickt them out, and a ſingle one in a decumbent poſture lay proſtrate at their feet, whoſe Northern Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity perform'd the Office of a <hi>Pedeſtal</hi> to the <hi>Embryo</hi> of a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which was but newly hatcht, and faſhion'd in a bed of Sand. The Declivity of a corner near the entrance into th' Pit gave occaſion to the water to <hi>ſtagnate</hi> into a Puddle; through which we did
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64126:28"/>not ſail, though the trajection was very ſhort, but fetching a circuit about its ſhore, we went out at the paſſage through which we enter'd. But no ſooner had we convey'd our ſelves out of this <hi>hole,</hi> but after we had trac'd o're ſome few Furlongs of a <hi>graſſy Pavement,</hi> a certain Moity of our Bodies pop'd into <hi>another,</hi> and a few ſteps after ſome of our feet happen'd into a third; and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while after, falling down, our hands were buried in two more. We wonder'd who had punch'd ſo many Eyelet-holes in the Earth's skin, till ſeeing a Robin <hi>Run-a-hole</hi> ſit mumping (like a Troglodite) in his houſe under ground, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Incloſure we were in, was a well peopled <hi>Warren:</hi> We had a frisk or two after the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the place; but their <hi>Heels</hi> prevented our deſign on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64126:29"/>their <hi>Scuts,</hi> for the nimbleneſs of the <hi>one</hi> ſecur'd them from impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Salt</hi> on the <hi>other.</hi> The <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of their Burrows de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them from the violence of all <hi>Perſecutions.</hi> Their <hi>Cells</hi> were contiguous, nay in ſome places they had broken down the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by a frequent <hi>Burglary</hi> did invade the privacy of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers apartments. The <hi>Dragon</hi> that kept this <hi>Garden</hi> of Coneys was a <hi>Zamzummin</hi> in ſtature, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Goliah,</hi> whoſe hand was <hi>Quarterſtafft</hi> with a mighty Beam. They told us of an <hi>Hercules</hi> or two that came to encounter this Keeper, who ('tis ſaid) did ſo <hi>out-club</hi> the Yermin, that inſtead of an <hi>Auger hole,</hi> he made them earth themſelves in the Aſylum of a <hi>Coney-hole.</hi> The <hi>Burrow</hi> of the Keeper ſtood near the center of his Dominions, being the <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64126:29"/>Seat of that little <hi>Nation</hi> of Rabbets. The <hi>Architecture</hi> of the Fabrick was not contemptible, being ſtately in height, whoſe top was <hi>crown'd</hi> with the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of <hi>Turrets,</hi> whoſe vigilant loftineſs had an eye to the ſecurity of the circumjacent Region: The biggeſt <hi>wonderment</hi> we beheld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, was, That its <hi>Head</hi> did not ſhoot ſo far <hi>upward</hi> into one Element, but its <hi>Feet</hi> ſunk as low <hi>downward</hi> into another, it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knee-deep, nay almoſt up to the Waſt in Earth, having as many Stories under ground as it had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. Whether the Bucks or Does were the <hi>Pioneers</hi> that dug thoſe Cellars, or whether the Architect deſign'd them on purpoſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the underminings of thoſe notable <hi>Delvers,</hi> we are not ſo well able to determine. We e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpy'd in a corner a <hi>wooden Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64126:30"/>or two, on purpoſe to entrap (we ſuppos'd) enſnaring Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, ſo that that living <hi>Gin,</hi> ſo fatal to Pullen, dy'd himſelf in a <hi>wile,</hi> and one <hi>Trap</hi> was <hi>trapan'd</hi> by another. 'Twas a well contriv'd <hi>Ambuſh,</hi> and pretty handſomely victual'd with a good luſty <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi> which ſo wrought upon Reynard, that he could not by any means reſiſt its charms, though 'tis thought he was as <hi>wiſe</hi> a Fox as any in <hi>Aeſop,</hi> whom we never met with, without a piece of <hi>Morality</hi> tackt to their Tails.</p>
            <p>Having paſs'd the Bounds of this <hi>Rabbet-Limbo,</hi> it was not long before we were embrac'd within the confines of a ſpot of ground like an Orchard; For the Ranges of Vegetables gave us a ſhrewd ſuſpition that <hi>Pomona</hi> had had her reſidence in that place: Here <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnus</hi> ſtood lolling under the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64126:30"/>preſſure of a Burden, being ſcarce able to bear ſo many <hi>wreaths</hi> of Fruit. His Head was crown'd ſo, that it bow'd with Apples; ſo that ſhaking his ears as we paſs'd through, he did ſo pelt us with a <hi>ſhower,</hi> that the unlading of his <hi>Noddle</hi> made <hi>fractures</hi> in our Pates, and rais'd <hi>Tumours</hi> in <hi>ſinciput</hi> as big as Kentiſh Pippins. The place was pretty <hi>populous</hi> with Trees, the <hi>ſquadrons</hi> whereof ſeem'd to be well diſciplin'd, ſtanding in their Ranks, and as it were in <hi>Battle-array</hi> like a well order'd Army.

Here were <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior</hi> and <hi>Superior,</hi> and (as it were) <hi>Dignify'd</hi> Fruit-Trees; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom there ſtood a Pear-Tree, I ſuppoſe Lord <hi>Primate</hi> of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64126:31"/>the <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> In a South-weſt corner we eſpy'd a few <hi>vermicula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> Hops, wrigling like worms up the <hi>Pyramid</hi> of a Pole; near which ſtood an Elm-Tree in the <hi>Arms</hi> of Ivy, which hugg'd it ſo cloſe, that it was almoſt <hi>incorporated</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by its <hi>claſping</hi> Embraces. The <hi>Poſteriours</hi> of the Elm-Tree were moſt barbarouſly <hi>chaſtiz'd</hi> by the Prickles of a Bramble, which the <hi>Breath</hi> of <hi>Aeolus</hi> would often move with ſmart Jerks. One of our company taking an occaſion to paſs by one of theſe unſeen Briars, they preſently had their <hi>Talons</hi> clawing upon his back, and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Man as much as the Buſh did <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> which catching him by the Coat, made him (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to be an Enemy) to cry out for Quarter: But the Fellow being <hi>cas'd</hi> in Leather, and the <hi>Buffneſs</hi> of his Coat being Armor-proof
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64126:31"/>againſt the Briſtles and (as it were) <hi>Hedghogiſm</hi> of their Prickles, they could not faſten their Fangs in his Garment, wherefore (thanks to his Stars) the Man had no hurt, but was bleſs'd with a great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. Toward the bottom of this Orchard lay proſtrate the Trunk of a ſlain <hi>Myrtle,</hi> and that not far from the verge or ſhadow of a <hi>Cops</hi> of Beans, pretty tall in ſtature, and well branch'd; by the <hi>Coverlets</hi> we ſaw there ſhould be <hi>Beds</hi> not far off, I ſuppoſe they were the <hi>Lodgings</hi> of Carrots, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, and of other Roots. There were <hi>Cabbages</hi> grown to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable <hi>globoſity,</hi> the roundneſs whereof tempted us to a Game at <hi>Foot-ball;</hi> we banded them about ſufficiently, and made ſome of them caper over a Ten-foot wall. One of the Gameſters was hat juſt in the mouth, the bore whereof
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64126:32"/>being too little for the Bullet, could not receive it into its <hi>Orifice,</hi> but however it <hi>gelded</hi> and dampt its fury, ſo that it did not retort with violence to the injury and detriment of any body elſe. We had ſweat longer at the Recreation and <hi>Olympick</hi> ſport of <hi>Kick-Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage,</hi> had not the Breath of <hi>Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina</hi> (her habitation being near) been ſo ſtrong, and been a nuſance unto us.</p>
            <p>So that being <hi>ſtunk</hi> out of our <hi>Quarters,</hi> we turn'd our <hi>Quarters</hi> upon the <hi>ſtink,</hi> and travel'd over a Grate into a Church-yard: The Track of our path lay between the <hi>Manſion houſe</hi> of the Levite on the left hand, and the <hi>Church</hi> on the right; behind which towards the South there <hi>ſtood</hi> or <hi>lay</hi> (we cannot tell which) a weather-beaten <hi>Tomb,</hi> which was <hi>Mouſe-eaten</hi> at one end by that <hi>Vermin</hi>

Here was a whole <hi>Herd</hi> of Swine a rooting as if they had been turn'd in on purpoſe to root up <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as they are in the Feilds in <hi>Italy</hi> to dig up Turffles. A little <hi>Wall</hi> lay ſculking about this Territory of the Dead, which we ſuppos'd was plac'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64126:33"/>there as a <hi>Bulwark</hi> to their Aſhes, but it prov'd but a feeble Fence againſt the intruſion of the Lambs, who made frequent <hi>Capreolls</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this adjacent Dormitory: The mound was rais'd a little, and cap'd with Turf, and environ'd with the hollowneſs of a good handſome Ditch; but yet, neither <hi>Cap</hi> nor Ditch could keep theſe Animals from <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We mounted this wall, and mov'd on towards the Weſtern period of our intended Journey.

The Weſtern Extremity of the Wheat-Hovil ſhot directly up the Barn, an <hi>Appendix</hi> to which ſtood the <hi>Apartment</hi> of the Hogs, over which was <hi>perch't</hi> a Rooſt for Poultry.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64126:65"/>great Wars; and made the <hi>ſnarl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of two Dogs <hi>thrive</hi> into an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the fighting of Maſtiffs to end in the Court of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Pleas.</hi> They commonly broach Quarrels, and incenſe the Shen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen into knockings and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, crack'd Crowns, and black Eyes, into Aſſaults and Batteries, and all for hopes of a Livelihood that may be <hi>skim</hi>'d from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ſuch Wars: But perhaps the <hi>Spoils</hi> from the Skirmiſhes of ſuch <hi>Clients</hi> are as rate as <hi>Pillage</hi> from a <hi>Scotch</hi> Army. The uſual crime for which they ſtand generally convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, is that great tranſgreſſion and <hi>ſin</hi> of <hi>Mice,</hi> the nimming of Cheeſe, and the filching of Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, and of the reſt of the good Creatures that are <hi>Arkt</hi> in the Cup-board; and as they <hi>offend like</hi> Vermin, ſo are ordinarily <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> ſo too, that is, not <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:64126:66"/>like Men, but <hi>entrap</hi>'d like Rats; after which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented before the Sage <hi>Puſs</hi> of the Law, which purring upon a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal together with his <hi>Kitling</hi> Officers, doth faſten on the Prey, and doth ſo ſuck and claw it, till it hath mumbled out all its <hi>Blood,</hi> that is, all the <hi>Money</hi> of its Veins, and then wholly devours it. This (I ſay) is <hi>one</hi> of their offences, though not the <hi>only</hi> one; for ſome of them have been laſht for an attempt upon <hi>Hen-Rooſts,</hi> and have receiv'd condign puniſhment even for ſtealing of Poultry at the <hi>wrong end;</hi> for Taphy (it ſeems) having filch'd a Chicken by the Breech, did <hi>diſrump</hi> her by his Theft; and therefore in reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to his Crime was almoſt <hi>diſrumpt</hi> by puniſhment; ſo that for ſtealing the <hi>Birds</hi> Tail, he had well-nigh loſt his <hi>own:</hi> A pretty

            </p>
            <p>For ſeveral Crimes they have various Puniſhments. That grand Enormity of <hi>Breaking-wind</hi> is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiz'd there as 'tis in <hi>England,</hi> that is, the hand of Magiſtracy doth uſually inflict a pretty luſty <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> that is, for every Report the loſs of an Hair, though ſome that have been much addicted to that Infirmity, and therefore have been very <hi>guilty</hi> of a ſtink, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd the cruelty of tormenting Faries, that is, have been pinch'd into manners, and a better <hi>ſmell.</hi> Artificers when at work puniſh any unhandſome Action by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſeverity peculiar to themſelves, which they call <hi>Purſing.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution whereof is after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Malefactor being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate

            <p>The Cattle we ſaw moſt <hi>legible</hi> on their Mountains were Goats and Heifers; a runtiſh ſort of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, of a <hi>dwarfiſh</hi> ſize, but very <hi>hardy,</hi> of a flinty Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>calculated</hi> on purpoſe for the <hi>meridian</hi> of a Rock; on which (it ſeems) they can as heartily feed, as an <hi>Oſtrich</hi> on an Anvil.

            <p>That which we admir'd moſt of all amongſt them, was the <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of their Language, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowr'd by the mixture of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dialect: The purity of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> was debauch'd by the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and was <hi>Hun'd</hi> into corruption by that barbarous People; but the ſincerity of the Brittiſh remains <hi>inviolable.</hi> 'Tis a Tongue (it ſeems) not made for every Mouth; as appears by an Inſtance of one in our Company, who having got a Welch <hi>Polyſyllable</hi> into his Throat, was almoſt choak'd with <hi>Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:64126:69"/>had we not by clapping him on the back made him <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge</hi> a Guttural or two, and ſo ſav'd him.

            <p>The <hi>Cambro-Brittons</hi> are great admirers of Heroick Actions, and much honour the Memory of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Atchievements; in ſo much, that rather than a <hi>Dead-doing</hi> Man ſhall periſh in Oblivion, they will Eternize his Name by the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Straw,</hi> or ſome ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable trifle; as appears by that Famous Example of that Saint of their Countrey, Biſhop <hi>David,</hi> who being a pert fighter, and having ſoundly <hi>baſted</hi> and
